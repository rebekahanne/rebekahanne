Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I am an Economics Ph.D. student at MIT. I'm interested in industrial organization, behavioral economics, computational economics, and macroeconomics. See my some of my research [here](https://rebekahanne.github.io/publication/). Before MIT, I studied economics, mathematics, computer science, and African Studies at UW-Madison.
