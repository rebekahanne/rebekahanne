Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at MIT. I will join Stanford University as an Assistant Professor of Economics in 2027, following postdoctoral fellowships at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

My main field of research is industrial organization, focusing on topics in innovation and health.

See some of my research [here](https://rebekahanne.github.io/research/). 

Before MIT, I studied economics, mathematics, and computer science at UW-Madison ðŸ¦¡.
