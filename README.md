Hi there 👋!

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at MIT. 

<!-- I will join Stanford University as an Assistant Professor of Economics in 2027, following postdoctoral fellowships at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.
-->

My main field of research is industrial organization, focusing on topics in innovation and health.

See some of my research [here](https://rebekahanne.github.io/research/). 

Before MIT, I studied economics, mathematics, and computer science at UW-Madison 🦡.
